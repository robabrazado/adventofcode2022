These are my solutions for the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) 2022. I'm using Java as my language of choice and Eclipse as my IDE. This is my second year participating in Advent of Code.

Each day's solution works independently from other days, though all days use the InputGetter class, which basiclaly just reads the contents of the input file and stuffs it into a String array of lines. Each day is in its own package, and the entry point for each day's solution will be the DayXXCli class, where XX is the left-zero-padded number of the day (e.g. "Day01Cli").

Shoutout to the fun folks at the [Indie Game Reading Club](https://www.indiegamereadingclub.com/) alongside whom I'm doing the Advent of Code this year! Thanks for the support and encouragement!
